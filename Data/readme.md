The various data we used in this project have been classified as follows:

1. demo_cover_images : To present the workflow of our project, we used two demo book title images which are stored in this folder.
2. demo_cxtracted_characters : The characters extracted from the images above are stored in this folder, with one subfolder for each image.
3. sample_jpegs : This folder has 100 sample images from our database of generated images.
4. sample_pdfs : This folder has 100 sample pdfs from our database of synthetically generated book title pages.
5. fonts : this folder has 482 font files which are used in the data generation process from Module 1. These fonts were obtained from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)
6. The two '.pkl' files -- authors.pkl and titles.pkl store the authors and titles obtained from scraping an online italian library in pythons [pickle](https://wiki.python.org/moin/UsingPickle) format. These files will help save time on redoing the scraping process which is very time consuming.
