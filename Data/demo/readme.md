## This folder includes all the sample data we have used throughout our pipeline as an example.

1. cover_images : To present the workflow of our project, we used two demo book title images which are stored in this folder.
2. extracted_characters : The characters extracted from the images above are stored in this folder, with one subfolder for each image.
3. predicted_letters : This folder holds the letter predictions of each demo cover page as separate .txt files, with each line in the document representing a line of text in the cover page.
4. segmented_words : This folder has the most likely words predicted by the segmentation module, with a .txt file for each cover page containing the words predicted. The content in these files is the final output of our model.
