The naming convention is ("label" + cropped + "image_number").jpg where label is the cluster that this character belongs to when all the characters in the image are clustered by their y-coordinates.

Storing the label helps to differentiate between text in each line, while the image_number helps to differentiate between the images themselves by giving each a unique identifier.
